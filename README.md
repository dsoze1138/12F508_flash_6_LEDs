12F508 Flasher of 6 Charlieplexed LEDs
======================================

This project is one possible implementation for the question in thread:

https://electronics.stackexchange.com/questions/401312/how-to-programm-a-pic12f508-to-light-leds

Three pins are used for the LEDs, the other three pins are used for device programming.

The application is written using the Microchip XC8 compiler in (free) mode so there is a lot of code bloat.
